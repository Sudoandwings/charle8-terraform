Charle8.com

Overview

This project showcases the complete design and deployment of a static website on AWS using Terraform, from the ground up. It was inspired by and evolved from my work on charle8.com, but rebuilt as a structured, fully automated Infrastructure as Code (IaC) solution. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate how to host a static website securely, efficiently, and repeatably on AWS without manual console work â€” using Terraform to orchestrate every step of the deployment.
The final result is a scalable, production-ready website infrastructure that uses AWS best practices for security, automation, and DNS/SSL configuration.
